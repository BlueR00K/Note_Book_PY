## 2. Introduction: Why Track New Python Features?

Python evolves rapidly, with each new version introducing features that improve developer productivity, code safety, and performance. Staying current with new features helps you write more modern, efficient, and maintainable code, and ensures compatibility with the latest libraries and frameworks.

---

## 3. Overview of Python Versioning and Release Cycle

- Python follows a predictable release schedule (PEP 602: annual releases)
- Each version introduces new features, optimizations, and deprecations
- Long-term support (LTS) and end-of-life (EOL) policies
- Use `sys.version_info` to check your Python version

```python
import sys
print(sys.version_info)
```

---

## 15. Advanced Usage, Migration, and Edge Cases

### 15.1. Deep Dive: Structural Pattern Matching (Python 3.10+)

Pattern matching is a major new feature, enabling expressive branching logic similar to switch/case in other languages, but more powerful.

```python
def process_command(cmd):
    match cmd:
        case {"action": "move", "direction": dir}:
            print(f"Moving {dir}")
        case [x, y]:
            print(f"Coordinates: {x}, {y}")
        case _:
            print("Unknown command")
```

#### Edge Cases

- Pattern matching is order-sensitive; the first match wins.
- Patterns can be nested and use guards (if-clauses).
- Not available in earlier Python versions; requires migration planning.

### 15.2. Migration Strategies for Large Codebases

- Use tools like `pyupgrade`, `2to3`, and linters to automate syntax updates.
- Run tests under multiple Python versions using CI/CD (tox, GitHub Actions).
- Gradually adopt new features in non-critical code first.
- Document deprecated features and plan for their removal.

### 15.3. Performance Benchmarks and Real-World Impact

Python 3.11+ brings significant speedups (10-60% in some workloads). Benchmark your code:

```python
import timeit
print(timeit.timeit('sum(range(1000))', number=10000))
```

#### Real-World Example

"Migrating to Python 3.11 reduced our API response times by 20% with no code changes."

### 15.4. Security Enhancements and Pitfalls

- New versions often change default behaviors for security (e.g., SSL, hashing).
- Deprecated modules may be removed (e.g., `imp`, `optparse`).
- Always review the security section of the "What's New" docs.

**Example:**

```python
import secrets
token = secrets.token_urlsafe(16)
```

### 15.5. Type Hinting: Advanced Patterns

- Use `typing.Literal`, `Final`, `Protocol` for advanced static typing.
- Type hints can be enforced with mypy, pyright, or Pyre.

```python
from typing import Literal, Final, Protocol
MAX_SIZE: Final = 100
def move(direction: Literal["left", "right"]): ...
class Drawable(Protocol):
    def draw(self) -> None: ...
```

### 15.6. Async and Concurrency: Best Practices

- Use `asyncio.run()` for top-level async code (Python 3.7+).
- Use `contextvars` for context management in async code.
- Exception groups (`except*`) simplify error handling in concurrent code (Python 3.11+).

```python
import asyncio
async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
asyncio.run(main())
```

### 15.7. Anti-Patterns and What to Avoid

- Using new syntax/features without checking minimum Python version.
- Relying on deprecated modules or syntax.
- Ignoring deprecation warnings in test output.
- Not pinning dependencies in requirements files.

**Example:**

```python
# BAD: Using match/case in code that must run on Python <3.10
def foo(x):
    match x:
        case 1: return 'one'
        case _: return 'other'
# This will fail on Python 3.9 and below.
```

## 16. Real-World Upgrade Stories and Lessons Learned

### 16.1. Upgrading a Data Science Project

- Migrated from Python 3.7 to 3.11
- Used `pyenv` and `tox` to test across versions
- Found that some packages lagged behind in support
- Saw 30% speedup in NumPy and pandas workloads

### 16.2. Enterprise Web Application

- Gradual migration: upgraded dev/test first, then production
- Used feature flags to enable new syntax
- Required code changes for pattern matching and new error messages

### 16.3. Open Source Library

- Maintained compatibility with 3.7+ using `typing_extensions`
- Used CI to test on all supported versions
- Documented minimum required Python version in README

---

## 17. Documenting and Testing for New Python Features

- Always document the minimum required Python version
- Use doctests and unit tests to verify new syntax and features
- Add CI jobs for all supported Python versions
- Use `warnings.simplefilter('error', DeprecationWarning)` in tests to catch deprecated usage

**Example:**

```python
import warnings
warnings.simplefilter('error', DeprecationWarning)
```

## 19. In-Depth: Pipe Operator for Union Types (Python 3.10+)

### 19.1. What is the Pipe Operator for Unions?

Prior to Python 3.10, type unions were written using `typing.Union`:

```python
from typing import Union
def handle(value: Union[int, str]):
    ...
```

From Python 3.10 onward, you can use the pipe (`|`) operator for a more concise syntax:

```python
def handle(value: int | str):
    ...
```

This works for all type hints, including complex nested types:

```python
def process(data: list[int | float] | None) -> None:
    ...
```

#### Benefits

- More readable and concise
- Consistent with set union notation
- Supported by static type checkers (mypy, pyright)

#### Migration Tip

If you need compatibility with Python <3.10, use `from __future__ import annotations` and/or `typing_extensions`.

## 20. In-Depth: Advanced Match-Case Usage

### 20.1. Matching Complex Data Structures

Pattern matching can destructure lists, dicts, and custom classes:

```python
def describe(obj):
    match obj:
        case [x, y, z]:
            return f"3D point: {x}, {y}, {z}"
        case {"type": "circle", "radius": r}:
            return f"Circle with radius {r}"
        case Point(x, y):
            return f"Point({x}, {y})"
        case _:
            return "Unknown object"
```

### 20.2. Using Guards (if-clauses)

```python
def classify(num):
    match num:
        case int() if num > 0:
            return "Positive integer"
        case int() if num < 0:
            return "Negative integer"
        case float():
            return "Float"
        case _:
            return "Other"
```

### 20.3. Matching with Enums and Classes

```python
from enum import Enum
class Color(Enum):
    RED = 1
    GREEN = 2
    BLUE = 3

def handle_color(c):
    match c:
        case Color.RED:
            return "Red!"
        case Color.GREEN:
            return "Green!"
        case Color.BLUE:
            return "Blue!"
```

### 20.4. Common Pitfalls

- Patterns are order-sensitive; the first match wins.
- Patterns must be exhaustive or include a wildcard (`_`).
- Only available in Python 3.10+.

---

## 21. Other Notable Features Worth Mastering

### 21.1. Parenthesized Context Managers (Python 3.10+)

Allows multiple context managers in a single `with` statement using parentheses:

```python
with (
    open('file1.txt') as f1,
    open('file2.txt') as f2
):
    data1 = f1.read()
    data2 = f2.read()
```

### 21.2. Precise Types in Error Messages (Python 3.10+)

Error messages now show the exact type that caused the error, making debugging easier:

```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y

add(1, 'a')  # TypeError: add() argument 'y' must be int, not str
```

### 21.3. New String Methods: removeprefix and removesuffix (Python 3.9+)

```python
text = 'unittest'
print(text.removeprefix('unit'))  # 'test'
print(text.removesuffix('test'))  # 'unit'
```

### 21.4. Exception Groups and except* (Python 3.11+)

Handle multiple exceptions in concurrent code:

```python
try:
    ...
except* ValueError as e:
    print("Caught ValueError in a group:", e)
```
