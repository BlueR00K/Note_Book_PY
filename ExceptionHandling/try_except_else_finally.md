## 2. Introduction

The complete form of Python's exception handling uses all four clauses: `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally`. This structure provides maximum control over error handling, success logic, and cleanup actions.

---

## 3. Syntax and Flow

The full structure looks like this:

```python
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
    ...
except SomeException:
    # Code to handle the exception
    ...
else:
    # Code to run if no exception occurs
    ...
finally:
    # Code that always runs (cleanup)
    ...
```

- The `try` block is always required.
- The `except` block(s) handle exceptions.
- The `else` block runs only if no exception occurs.
- The `finally` block always runs, even if an exception is raised or a return/break/continue is executed.

---

## 4. Purpose and Use Cases for Each Clause

- **try:** Wraps code that might raise exceptions.
- **except:** Handles specific or general exceptions.
- **else:** Runs if no exception occurs in the try block. Good for code that should only run on success.
- **finally:** Always runs, used for cleanup (closing files, releasing resources, etc.), regardless of exceptions.

---

## 5. Detailed Examples for Each Clause

### 5.1. Basic Example

```python
try:
    print("Trying division...")
    result = 10 / 2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
else:
    print(f"Division successful: {result}")
finally:
    print("This always runs (cleanup)")
```

### 5.2. Example with Exception

```python
try:
    print("Trying division by zero...")
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(f"Caught exception: {e}")
else:
    print(f"Division successful: {result}")
finally:
    print("Cleanup actions")
```

### 5.3. File Handling Example

```python
try:
    f = open('data.txt')
    data = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found.")
else:
    print("File read successfully.")
finally:
    try:
        f.close()
    except Exception:
        pass
```

### 5.4. Multiple Except Blocks

```python
try:
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    y = 10 / x
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input!")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
else:
    print(f"Result: {y}")
finally:
    print("Done.")
```

### 5.5. Nested try/except/else/finally

```python
try:
    try:
        print("Inner try")
        1 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Inner except")
    else:
        print("Inner else")
    finally:
        print("Inner finally")
except Exception:
    print("Outer except")
finally:
    print("Outer finally")
```

## 6. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- Keep try blocks as small as possible.
- Catch only exceptions you can handle meaningfully.
- Use finally for cleanup, not for main logic.
- Avoid bare except: (catches all exceptions, including system-exiting ones).
- Document expected exceptions in your code.
- Don’t use exceptions for normal control flow.
- Always close resources (files, sockets, etc.) in finally or with context managers.

**Anti-pattern:**

```python
try:
    # Too much code here
    risky()
    another_risky()
except Exception:
    print("Something went wrong")
# BAD: hard to know what failed
```

## 7. Real-World Scenarios and Advanced Usage

### 7.1. Database Operations

```python
import sqlite3
conn = None
try:
    conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM users')
except sqlite3.DatabaseError as e:
    print(f"Database error: {e}")
else:
    print("Query successful.")
finally:
    if conn:
        conn.close()
```

### 7.2. Network Operations

```python
import requests
try:
    response = requests.get('https://example.com')
    response.raise_for_status()
except requests.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Network error: {e}")
else:
    print("Request successful.")
finally:
    print("Network operation complete.")
```

### 7.3. Custom Exception Classes

```python
class CustomError(Exception):
    pass

try:
    raise CustomError("Something custom went wrong!")
except CustomError as e:
    print(f"Caught custom error: {e}")
finally:
    print("Handled custom error.")
```

### 7.4. Resource Management

```python
def process_file(filename):
    f = None
    try:
        f = open(filename)
        # process file
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    else:
        print("Processing complete.")
    finally:
        if f:
            f.close()
```

### 7.5. Exception Chaining and Re-raising

```python
def parse_int(s):
    try:
        return int(s)
    except ValueError as e:
        raise RuntimeError("Failed to parse int") from e

try:
    parse_int("abc")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Chained exception: {e}")
    print(f"Original cause: {e.__cause__}")
finally:
    print("Chaining demo complete.")
```

## 8. Comparison with Other Languages

- In Java, try/catch/finally is similar, but else is not available.
- In C++, try/catch/finally is possible with RAII (destructors for cleanup).
- Python’s else clause is unique and encourages separation of success logic from error handling.
- Python’s finally is like Java’s finally: always runs.

---

## 9. Summary and Key Takeaways

- Use the complete form for maximum control over error handling and cleanup.
- Use else for code that should only run if no exception occurs.
- Use finally for cleanup, regardless of success or failure.
- Keep try blocks small and focused.
- Handle only exceptions you expect and can manage.
- Document and test your exception handling logic.
