# Python Package Management: pip, PyPI, and Beyond

## 1. Introduction

Package management is essential for installing, updating, and sharing Python libraries and applications. Python’s ecosystem is powered by tools like pip and the Python Package Index (PyPI).

---

## 2. What is pip?

- **pip** is the standard package manager for Python.
- Installs, upgrades, and uninstalls packages from PyPI and other sources.
- Command-line tool: `pip install package_name`
- Supports requirements files, version specifiers, and more.
- Ships with Python 3.4+ (use `python -m pip` for reliability).

---

## 3. What is PyPI?

- **PyPI (Python Package Index)** is the official repository of Python packages.
- Hosts over 400,000 projects: libraries, frameworks, tools, and applications.
- Website: <https://pypi.org>
- Packages are uploaded by developers and can be installed via pip.

---

## 4. Installing Packages

- `pip install requests` — install latest version
- `pip install requests==2.31.0` — install specific version
- `pip install requests>=2.0,<3.0` — version range
- `pip install ./local_folder` — install from local source
- `pip install git+https://github.com/user/repo.git` — install from Git
- Use `--user` to install for current user only

---

## 5. Requirements Files

- List dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file:

  ```
  requests>=2.0
  numpy==1.25.0
  flask
  ```

- Install all with: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Can pin versions, use comments, and include other requirements files.

---

## 6. Upgrading and Uninstalling

- `pip install --upgrade package_name`
- `pip uninstall package_name`
- `pip list` — show installed packages
- `pip show package_name` — show details

---

## 7. Virtual Environments

- Isolate dependencies for each project.
- Tools: `venv` (built-in), `virtualenv`, `conda` (Anaconda/Miniconda)
- Create: `python -m venv venv`
- Activate:
  - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
  - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Deactivate: `deactivate`
- Install packages inside the environment for project isolation.

---

## 8. Creating and Publishing Your Own Packages

- Structure your project with a `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`.
- Add metadata: name, version, author, description, dependencies, etc.
- Build with `python -m build` (requires `build` package).
- Upload to PyPI with `twine`:
  - `python -m pip install --upgrade build twine`
  - `python -m build`
  - `python -m twine upload dist/*`
- Use test.pypi.org for testing uploads.

---

## 9. PyPI Alternatives and Mirrors

- **TestPyPI**: <https://test.pypi.org> for testing uploads
- **Private indexes**: e.g., Artifactory, Nexus, devpi
- **Mirrors**: Use `-i https://pypi.org/simple` or a custom index URL

---

## 10. Dependency Management Tools

- **pip-tools**: `pip-compile` for locking dependencies
- **Poetry**: Modern tool for dependency management and packaging
- **PDM**: PEP 582/modern workflow
- **Conda**: For scientific Python, manages non-Python deps too
- **Hatch, Flit**: Other modern build tools

---

## 11. Editable Installs and Local Development

- `pip install -e .` — install package in "editable" mode (dev workflow)
- Changes to code are reflected immediately
- Useful for developing libraries and apps

---

## 12. Security and Best Practices

- Use virtual environments for every project
- Pin dependencies for reproducibility
- Review dependencies for vulnerabilities (use `pip-audit`, `safety`)
- Avoid `sudo pip install` (use `--user` or venv)
- Keep pip and setuptools updated
- Use trusted sources (PyPI, company index)

---

## 13. Common pip Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| pip install package | Install a package |
| pip install --upgrade package | Upgrade a package |
| pip install -r requirements.txt | Install from requirements file |
| pip install --user package | Install for current user only |
| pip install --pre package | Install pre-release version |
| pip install --force-reinstall package | Force reinstall even if up-to-date |
| pip install --no-deps package | Install without dependencies |
| pip uninstall package | Remove a package |
| pip list | List installed packages |
| pip list --outdated | List outdated packages |
| pip freeze | Output installed packages (for requirements.txt) |
| pip show package | Show package info |
| pip search keyword | Search PyPI (deprecated, use web) |
| pip check | Check for broken dependencies |
| pip cache dir | Show pip cache directory |
| pip cache purge | Remove all pip cache |
| pip install -e . | Editable/development install |
| pip wheel . | Build a wheel from the current directory |
| pip download package | Download package without installing |
| pip debug | Show environment and configuration info |
| python -m pip install --upgrade pip | Upgrade pip itself |

---

## 14. Troubleshooting

- **pip not found**: Use `python -m pip` or check PATH
- **SSL errors**: Update pip, Python, or CA certificates
- **Permission errors**: Use `--user` or venv
- **Conflicting packages**: Use `pip check` and virtual environments
- **Proxy/firewall issues**: Set `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` env vars

---

## 15. PyPI Metadata and Project Pages

- Each package on PyPI has a project page with docs, releases, and metadata
- Metadata includes: name, version, author, license, classifiers, dependencies, etc.
- Use `pip show package` to see metadata locally

---

## 16. Advanced Topics

- **Wheels**: Pre-built binary packages (`.whl`), faster installs
- **Source distributions (sdist)**: Install from source code
- **PEP 517/518**: Modern build system standards
- **Namespace packages**: Split packages across multiple distributions
- **Dependency resolution**: How pip chooses compatible versions
- **Hash checking mode**: `--require-hashes` for security
- **Constraints files**: Pin or limit versions across requirements

---

## 17. Real-World Use Cases

- Setting up reproducible dev environments
- Deploying apps to servers or cloud
- Sharing code with teams or the world
- Building and distributing CLI tools
- Managing dependencies for data science, web, automation, etc.

---

## 18. Best Practices

- Use virtual environments and requirements files
- Prefer pip and PyPI for open-source packages
- Use modern tools (Poetry, pip-tools) for complex projects
- Document dependencies and setup steps
- Regularly update and audit dependencies

---

## Advanced & Real-World Examples

### 1. Creating and Using a Virtual Environment

Isolate dependencies for a project:

```sh
python -m venv venv
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
pip install requests
```

---

### 2. Building and Publishing a Package to PyPI

Share your code with the world:

```sh
# pyproject.toml (modern packaging)
[project]
name = "mycoolpkg"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A cool package"
authors = [ { name = "You", email = "you@example.com" } ]

# Build and upload
python -m pip install --upgrade build twine
python -m build
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

---

### 3. Pinning and Freezing Dependencies for Reproducibility

Create a requirements file for exact versions:

```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
# Later, or on another machine:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Using pip-tools for Dependency Management

Lock all dependencies for a project:

```sh
pip install pip-tools
# requirements.in contains top-level deps
pip-compile requirements.in  # generates requirements.txt with all pins
pip-sync requirements.txt    # installs exactly what's listed
```

---

### 5. Installing from GitHub or a Local Directory

Install a package directly from a repo or folder:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/psf/requests.git
pip install ./my_local_package
```

---

### 6. Editable Installs for Local Development

Work on a package and see changes instantly:

```sh
cd myproject
pip install -e .
# Edit code, changes are reflected immediately
```

---

### 7. Auditing Dependencies for Security

Check for known vulnerabilities:

```sh
pip install pip-audit
pip-audit
# Or use 'safety' for similar checks
```

---

### 8. Using Constraints Files for Large Projects

Control versions across multiple requirements files:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt
```
