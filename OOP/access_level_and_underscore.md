# Access Level and Applications of _ (Underscore) in Python

## 1. Introduction

The underscore (`_`) is a powerful and versatile character in Python, used in various contexts to indicate access levels, ignore values, and for special naming conventions. Understanding its applications is essential for writing idiomatic and maintainable Python code.

## 2. Access Levels in Python

- Python does not have true access modifiers (like `private`, `protected`, `public` in other languages).
- Instead, naming conventions using underscores communicate the intended access level:

### a) Public Attributes/Methods
- No leading underscore.
- Intended for use everywhere.

### b) Protected Attributes/Methods
- Single leading underscore: `_var`
- Indicates "internal use" (should not be accessed from outside the class/module).
- Not enforced by Python, just a convention.

### c) Private Attributes/Methods
- Double leading underscore: `__var`
- Name mangling: Python changes the name to `_ClassName__var` to avoid accidental access.
- Still accessible, but harder to access from outside.

### Example:
```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.public = 1
        self._protected = 2
        self.__private = 3

obj = MyClass()
print(obj.public)      # 1
print(obj._protected)  # 2 (convention: internal use)
# print(obj.__private) # AttributeError
print(obj._MyClass__private)  # 3 (name mangling)
```

## 3. Applications of the Underscore (`_`)

### a) As a Throwaway Variable
- Used to indicate a value is intentionally ignored.

```python
for _ in range(5):
    print("Hello")
```

### b) In Unpacking
- Ignore specific values when unpacking.

```python
x, _, y = (1, 2, 3)
```

### c) As the Last Expression Result in the REPL
- In the interactive interpreter, `_` stores the result of the last expression.

```python
>>> 2 + 3
5
>>> _
5
```

### d) In Internationalization (i18n)
- `_` is often used as an alias for translation functions.

```python
from gettext import gettext as _
print(_("Hello"))
```

### e) In Numeric Literals for Readability
- Underscores can be used to separate digits in numbers (since Python 3.6).

```python
one_million = 1_000_000
```

## 4. Best Practices

- Use single underscore for protected members, double underscore for private.
- Use `_` for throwaway variables and ignored values.
- Avoid using `_` as a variable name if it is used for i18n in your project.
- Use underscores in numeric literals for clarity.
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions.
